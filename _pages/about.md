Hi there! My name is Jiachen Guo, and I am a junior undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electronics Science and Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://sa.hit.edu.cn/main.htm).

I am keen on finding the shortest path for efficient and effective learning in the network composed by college courses and all materials about Mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. [This graph]() is my courses studied, referring [UCB EECS](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/assets/course-map-2019-da79ecbe2fc25e6b6349b8931364890032b8d51aacaccea65151ae98316f0587.png) and [THU EE](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/__local/8/45/D5/C250657FF930A2B3FC5F593B31D_58753221_5024D.png) and inspired by [Zeyuan Allen-Zhu](http://zeyuan.allen-zhu.com). I have released my notes in "AllinMe4-It" serial github repositories.
