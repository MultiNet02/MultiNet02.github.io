Hi there! My name is Jiachen Guo, and I am a junior undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electronics Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology. I am keen on finding the shortest path for efficient and effective learning in the network composed by college courses and all materials about Mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. [Here]() is my courses studied, referring [UCB EECS](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/assets/course-map-2019-da79ecbe2fc25e6b6349b8931364890032b8d51aacaccea65151ae98316f0587.png) and [THU EE](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/__local/8/45/D5/C250657FF930A2B3FC5F593B31D_58753221_5024D.png) and inspired by [Zeyuan Allen-Zhu](http://zeyuan.allen-zhu.com). I have released my notes in "AllinMe4-It" serial github repositories. <br>

Research Interests
======
I am interested in Graph Neural Network, Embodied AI, SLAM, Multimodal LLM and Quantitative Trading.

RESEARCH CONCENTRATION 1: Graph Neural Network 
* Recommender Systems
* Urban Science
* AI4Science

RESEARCH CONCENTRATION 2: 3D Vision and Robotic Manipulation
* 3D Reconstruction
* Deep Reinforcement Learning

RESEARCH CONCENTRATION 3: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
* IMU and Pose Estimation

RESEARCH CONCENTRATION 4: Multimodal LLM [more info in my Blogs](https://multinet02.github.io/year-archive/)
* ChatGLM
* LLaMa
* Qwen

RESEARCH CONCENTRATION 5: Quantitative Trading
* WorldQuant 
* Microsoft Qlib

The main objective of my PhD study is the exploration and development of data-efficient, high-performance, risk-aware, and privacy-preserving diagnostic systems through physiological signals like respiratory and heart sound, to achieve ubiquitous, affordable, and non-invasive daily pathological screening, diagnosis, and monitoring from home. By harnessing the power of small data learning and probabilistic machine learning, I aim to propose novel solutions for the data imbalance and uncertainty estimation obstacles when applying machine learning to reliable health diagnoses. I am also investigating decentralized model training techniques to allow privacy-preserving mobile health applications. A brief map of my research:
  -  Reliable and unbiased DL for health [[NPJ2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00553-x)] 
  -  Uncertainty quantification for health diagnostics [[INTERSPEECH2021](http://XTxiatong.github.io/files/InterSpeech2021_COVID_Ensemble.pdf)][[TSRML2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Nr1RDmAx-Qm)]
  -  Decentralised mobile health model training [[ICASSP2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07067)]
